I told him, \"I'm losin' my grip\" He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself Then let yourself slip'' Fall, ooh Fall, oh Fall Oh, it feels good to fall Ooh, ooh These puzzles are so hard to make into pictures Of something that they'll understand They could open their eyes, still be blind to the beauty But march on the heart of this land, oh oh Why don't you turn around and go home? They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense These things that a man doesn't need Take out the love and the passion and hope And they fill it with nothing but greed While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't I noticed how sad one can get 'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find I can't understand nothing no more If I jump, let me...
