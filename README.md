# Mac-Miller-Lyrics-NLP

I found a JSON file of Mac Miller Lyrics and wanted to do a little exercise to test out semantic language analysis using the Spacy NLP Framework.

The goal of this project is to take user input and perform a semantic analysis on it. That input will then be compared against each song found in the lyrics.json file imported from https://github.com/timbmg/mac-miller-lyrics-dataset/blob/main/data/lyrics.json. The algorithm will then compare the semantic similaric using Spacy Natural Language Processing methods.

I included in this project various different inputs then provided my own verbal write up of how the model performed in each case.

For the first input, I also provided a pandasgui display that allows for various data visualizations.

There is a lot to build on with this data, and these workflows.

Let's take a look at my approach to this topic!
